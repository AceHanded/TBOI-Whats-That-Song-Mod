# What's That Song?

<b>Have you ever wondered: "Hey! What's that song that's currently playing actually called?" Well, wonder no more, as I have the solution to your problem!</b>

This is a fairly simple mod that displays the name of the currently playing song, as it is in the official soundtrack.

The mod includes support for Mod Configuration Menu Pure, and in case you don't have that installed, and don't wish to, there is also a configuration file in the mod's directory 
(by default found at `/steam/steamapps/common/The Binding of Isaac Rebirth/mods/whats that song_3267389419/whatsThatConfig.lua`), where you can tweak certain aspects of the mod to your liking.

There is currently also support for the mods <b>Antibirth music++</b> and <b>Soundtrack Menu</b> (at least all the base tracks), though you can get more tracks added by:
<ol>
    <li>Adding them directly to the `whatsThatMusicIDTable.lua` file.</li>
    <li>Making your own "plugin" mod, utilizing the WhatsThatSongAPI interface.</li>
    <li>Asking nicely.</li>
</ol>

If you are using other music-altering mods besides these, I cannot guarantee that the mod will work as expected. Additionally, if you opt for choices 1 or 2, it would be oh so very kind of you to share your contribution with me, so I could add it for others' use as well.
