<b>Have you ever wondered: "Hey! What's that song that's currently playing actually called?" Well, wonder no more, as I have the solution to your problem!</b>

This is a fairly simple mod that displays the name of the currently playing song, as it is in the official soundtrack.

The mod includes support for Mod Configuration Mod Pure, and in case you don't have that installed, and don't wish to, there is also a configuration file in the mod's directory 
(by default found at `/steam/steamapps/common/The Binding of Isaac Rebirth/mods/whats that song_3267389419/whatsThatConfig.lua`), where you can tweak certain aspects of the mod to your liking.
