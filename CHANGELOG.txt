v1.0.5
- Overhauled the way song IDs are resolved.
   * Moved from statically to dynamically assigned IDs, which, to be fair, should have been done from the beginning.
   * This mod no longer messes up other music mods, and vice versa, meaning that you can use as many music altering mods, while still getting correct results for those supported by this mod.
- Replaced "whatsThatMusicIDTable.lua" with "whatsThatMusicTableHell.lua".
- Dropped support for "Antibirth music++", in favor of focusing on expanding Soundtrack Menu support.
- Fixed some incorrect song titles.
- Modified some configuration options.
   * IgnoreNumerals is now set to "true" by default.
- Expanded the WhatsThatSongAPI.
   * The API is now actually usable (:D).
   * Added new method "AddSoundtrack()" alongside the already existing "AddSong()", whose usage is easy as 1-2-3!
   * As opposed to "AddSong()", which is meant for adding / modifying single IDs, "AddSoundtrack()" makes it possible to add support for entire soundtracks supported by Soundtrack Menu. I recommend viewing the official mod page of Soundtrack Menu for more information (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1933285222).

   * TabOffsetX, TabOffsetY - Makes it possible to offset the "Tab" notification on the X and Y axes.
   * TabSizeX, TabSizeY - Makes it possible to modify the size of the "Tab" notification on the X and Y axes.
   * IgnoreNumerals - Makes it possible to ignore displaying numeral music IDs in the notifications.

   * SoundtrackChoice removed due to its redundancy.
- Music ID table moved to its own file: "whatsThatMusicIDTable.lua".

v1.0.3
- Changed config file name to "whatsThatConfig.lua" in order to avoid conflicts with other mods.
