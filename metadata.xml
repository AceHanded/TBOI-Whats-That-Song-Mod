    <description>[b]Have you ever wondered: &quot;Hey! What's that song that's currently playing actually called&quot;? Well, wonder no more, as I have the solution to your problem![/b]

This is a fairly simple mod that displays the name of the currently playing song, as it is in the official soundtrack.

For those that are more technologically versed (just kidding, you need not know much), there is a configuration file in the mod's directory (`by default found at /steam/steamapps/common/The Binding of Isaac Rebirth/mods/whats that song/config.lua`), where you can tweak certain aspects of the mod to your liking. The configuration file also includes support for the Antibirth soundtrack, whose usage I would have liked to check automatically, but I am unsure if that is even possible.

All issues, suggestions and other concerns should be brought forth on the mod's [url=https://github.com/AceHanded/TBOI-Whats-That-Song-Mod/issues]GitHub page[/url].</description>
