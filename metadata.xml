[h1]Description[/h1]

[b]Have you ever wondered: &quot;Hey! What's that song that's currently playing actually called?&quot; Well, wonder no more, as I have the solution to your problem![/b]

This is a fairly simple mod that displays the name of the currently playing song, as it is in the official soundtrack.

The mod includes support for [b]Mod Configuration Menu Pure[/b], and in case you don't have that installed, and don't wish to, there is also a configuration file in the mod's directory (by default found at `/steam/steamapps/common/The Binding of Isaac Rebirth/mods/whats that song_3267389419/whatsThatConfig.lua`), where you can tweak certain aspects of the mod to your liking.

There is currently also support for the [b]Soundtrack Menu[/b], along with a few soundtrack mods, though you can get more tracks added by:
[olist]
    [*]Adding them directly to the `whatsThatMusicTableHell.lua` file (Not Recommended).
    [*]Making your own &quot;plugin&quot; mod, utilizing the WhatsThatSongAPI interface.
    [*]Asking nicely.
[/olist]
Soundtrack mods with built-in support:
[list]
    [*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2499546769]The Binding of Isaac: Mutations Soundtrack[/url] 
    [*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2523708160]Spelunky 1 + 2 Music[/url] 
    [*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2532793042]Hotline Miami 1/2 Soundtrack[/url] 
    [*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2507009001]A Hat in Time Soundtrack[/url] 
[/list]
If you are using other music-altering mods besides these, the mod should still work perfectly fine for supported soundtracks. Additionally, if you opt for choice 1 for some reason, it would be oh so very kind of you to share your contribution with me, so I could add it for others' use as well.

[h1]API Example[/h1]

[b]Below is an example of how to use the WhatsThatSongAPI, alongside Soundtrack Menu.
(Man, I hate Steam's formatting.)[/b]

--[[ API ]]--

YourModName = RegisterMod(&quot;ModName&quot;, 1)

local yourSoundtrackTitles = {
    -- Here go the displayed titles, in correspondence with the formatting of Soundtrack Menu.
}

YourModName:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_GAME_STARTED, function()
    -- Check existance of Soundtrack Menu
    if SoundtrackSongList then
        -- The value used in place of &quot;Your Soundtrack Name&quot;
        -- should be same in both AddSoundtrackToMenu and WhatsThatSongAPI:AddSoundtrack
        AddSoundtrackToMenu(&quot;Your Soundtrack Name&quot;)

        -- Check existance of What's That Song?
        if WhatsThatSong then
            -- Very simple to use; returns true if addition was successful, otherwise false
            if WhatsThatSongAPI:AddSoundtrack(&quot;Your Soundtrack Name&quot;, yourSoundtrackTitles) then
                Isaac.ConsoleOutput(&quot;Successfully added titles of Your Soundtrack to What's That Song?\n&quot;)
            else
                Isaac.ConsoleOutput(&quot;Failed to add titles of Your Soundtrack to What's That Song?\n&quot;)
            end
        end
    else
        Isaac.ConsoleOutput(&quot;Soundtrack Menu is required for adding the soundtrack!\n&quot;)
    end
end)

All issues, suggestions and other concerns should be brought forth on the mod's [url=https://github.com/AceHanded/TBOI-Whats-That-Song-Mod/issues]GitHub page[/url].</description>
